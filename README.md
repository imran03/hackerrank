# hackerrank

I discovered HackerRank a while ago, and I really love doing their challenges.

I wanted to share my solution here, as it would be great if it could help others who get stuck 
(only get direction, don't cheat :) )

One more thing it would be great to here more opinions about the code, where could I improve it and more.

After each solution I do, I browse the other submits of other programers 
and you can see the variety of thinking and syntax changes, so it is a great spot to learn more.

## * It would be great to here from you, advices, questions etc...
you can contact me here threw "issuing an issue" or emailing me or visit my blog
